# Code: Who, what, why, where, and when?

Customers, it turns out, don't really want our code. They want what it can do for them. Hundreds of the Gamers aren't dropping 50 quid on the latest Call of Duty because of the elegance of the 3D rendering algorithms, but because they want to run around in virtual world shouting things like "up on the left! up on the left! I said UP ON THE LEFT!"

The people who use our code want what it can do, what it enables, what it helps, what it achieves. The actual process of writing code is, generally, a mystery to them. *Who* then are we writing the code for? *What* makes good code? *Why* do we write code? *Where* should we focus our attention? *When* should we stop, or start afresh? Code can be the driving force behind our business, while also being the company's biggest liability. The code we write today might be gone tomorrow, or still be running in fifty years time.

In this session we'll consider the paradox of code, and examine some of these questions. We'll also consider some possible answers, and how that shapes the way we might approach our code.
